SCHEMA REFERENCE
CrawlerFile Schema v1.0
This document defines the fields used in CrawlerFile entity profiles. Every profile published by CrawlerFile.com conforms to this specification. This page is the authoritative definition of all field names, types, permitted values, and intended meanings.

Layer 1 — Envelope Fields
These fields appear in every CrawlerFile profile regardless of content. They describe the file itself, establish its provenance, and enable verification. All Layer 1 fields are required unless noted.
FIELD
TYPE
REQUIRED
DEFINITION
schema_version
string
REQUIRED
The version of the CrawlerFile schema this file conforms to. Used by consumers to parse the file correctly. Current value: "1.0"
schema_docs
url
REQUIRED
A URL pointing to the authoritative schema definition for the declared schema_version. Allows any consumer to look up field definitions without prior knowledge of CrawlerFile. Current value: "https://crawlerfile.com/schema/v1"
file_id
string
REQUIRED
A unique identifier for this specific file. Stable across updates — the same file retains its file_id when its content changes. Format: cf_ prefix followed by an alphanumeric string.
entity_id
string
REQUIRED
A unique identifier for the entity this file describes. Stable regardless of domain changes, rebranding, or acquisition. An entity may have multiple files (different file_id values) but always shares one entity_id. Format: ent_ prefix followed by an alphanumeric string.
entity_domain
string
REQUIRED
The primary registered domain of the entity (e.g. "example.com"). Used as a human-readable identifier and as the root for verification. Does not include protocol or path.
entity_verification_url
url
REQUIRED
The full URL on the entity's own domain where the verification_token can be confirmed. Any crawler or consumer can fetch this URL and verify that the token appears there, confirming the entity authorized this profile. See Verification Protocol.
verification_token
string
REQUIRED
A unique token that appears both in this file and at the entity_verification_url on the entity's own domain. Its presence in both locations confirms the entity authorized this profile. Format: cft_ prefix followed by a UUID.
content_type
enum
REQUIRED
Describes what kind of data this file contains. Allows consumers to identify relevant files without parsing the full content.
full_profile — Complete entity profile combining all available sections
identity — Basic entity identity only
services — Products and services section only
people — Leadership and personnel section only
policies — Policy declarations only
ai_policy — AI-specific policy declarations only 
publisher
string
REQUIRED
The domain of the platform that published this file. For all files published by CrawlerFile: "crawlerfile.com"
published_date
date
REQUIRED
The ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) on which this version of the file was published or last updated. Consumers should use this to assess data freshness.

Layer 2 — Entity Identity
Core descriptive fields about the entity. These use Schema.org Organization vocabulary where applicable, extending it with additional fields where needed. All Layer 2 fields are optional unless noted — entities publish what is relevant and accurate for them.
Schema.org compatibility: CrawlerFile profiles include "@context": "https://schema.org" and "@type": "Organization" in the entity object. Fields that map directly to Schema.org properties use Schema.org field names. Custom fields not covered by Schema.org are documented here. 

Layer 3 — AI Policy
The aiPolicy object allows entities to formally declare their policies regarding the use of their data by AI systems. These declarations are timestamped and verifiable. While CrawlerFile cannot guarantee that all AI systems will honor these declarations, their publication creates a formal, machine-readable record of the entity's stated intent.
FIELD
TYPE
REQUIRED
DEFINITION
trainingDataConsent
enum
OPTIONAL
Whether the entity permits the contents of this profile to be used as training data for AI/ML models.
permitted — Unrestricted use for AI training
not_permitted — Use for AI training is not authorized
conditional — Permitted subject to conditions described in notes or at aiInquiriesContact 
retrievalConsent
enum
OPTIONAL
Whether the entity permits this profile to be used in real-time retrieval systems (e.g. RAG pipelines, search-augmented AI responses). Distinct from training consent — an entity may permit retrieval but not training.
permitted — Retrieval use is authorized
not_permitted — Retrieval use is not authorized
conditional — Permitted subject to conditions 
requiresAttribution
boolean
OPTIONAL
Whether the entity requires attribution when its data is used or cited by AI systems. If true, the preferred attribution format should be provided in attributionFormat.
attributionFormat
string
OPTIONAL
The preferred attribution string to use when citing this entity's data. Only meaningful when requiresAttribution is true. Example: "Multiplier Advisors (multiplieradvisors.com)"
dataFreshnessSLA
enum
OPTIONAL
How frequently this profile is reviewed and updated by the entity. Consumers can use this to assess whether the data is likely still current.
realtime — Continuously maintained
weekly — Reviewed weekly
monthly — Reviewed monthly
quarterly — Reviewed quarterly
annually — Reviewed annually
as_needed — Updated when significant changes occur 
expiryDate
date
OPTIONAL
ISO 8601 date after which consumers should treat this profile as potentially stale and seek a more current version. If omitted, the profile does not have a declared expiry.
aiInquiriesContact
string
OPTIONAL
An email address or URL where AI companies, researchers, or developers can direct inquiries about data use permissions for this entity.
notes
string
OPTIONAL
Free-text field for additional context about this entity's AI data use policies, particularly useful when any consent field is set to conditional.

Verification Protocol
The CrawlerFile verification protocol allows any crawler or consumer to independently confirm that the entity named in a profile has authorized its publication — without contacting CrawlerFile directly.
STEP 01
Read the verification_token and entity_verification_url fields from the CrawlerFile profile.
STEP 02
Fetch the entity_verification_url. This URL is on the entity's own domain, not on crawlerfile.com.
STEP 03
Confirm the verification_token string appears in the fetched page. If it does, the entity has authorized this profile.
For entities: Place your verification token in a visible location on the designated page — a meta tag, a plain-text paragraph, or a small JSON snippet in your page source all work. The token only needs to be present; it does not need to be displayed prominently to human visitors. 

Versioning
CrawlerFile schema versions are identified by the schema_version field and documented at stable URLs of the form https://crawlerfile.com/schema/v{N}. This page documents v1.0.
Backwards compatibility: Minor updates to an existing version (clarifications, new optional fields) do not change the version number. Breaking changes — renamed required fields, changed enum values, structural changes — always increment the version. Existing files are never retroactively invalidated; older schema versions remain documented at their original URLs.
