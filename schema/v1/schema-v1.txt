SCHEMA REFERENCE
CrawlerFile Schema v1.0
This document defines the fields used in CrawlerFile entity profiles. Every profile published by CrawlerFile.com conforms to this specification. This page is the authoritative definition of all field names, types, permitted values, and intended meanings.

Layer 1 — Envelope Fields
These fields appear in every CrawlerFile profile regardless of content. They describe the file itself, establish its provenance, and enable verification. All Layer 1 fields are required unless noted.
FIELD
TYPE
REQUIRED
DEFINITION
schemaVersion
string
REQUIRED
The version of the CrawlerFile schema this file conforms to. Used by consumers to parse the file correctly. Current value: "1.0"
schemaDocs
url
REQUIRED
A URL pointing to the authoritative schema definition for the declared schemaVersion. Allows any consumer to look up field definitions without prior knowledge of CrawlerFile. Current value: "https://crawlerfile.com/schema/v1"
fileId
string
REQUIRED
A unique identifier for this specific file. Stable across updates — the same file retains its fileId when its content changes. Format: UUID.
entityId
string
REQUIRED
A unique identifier for the entity this file describes. Stable regardless of domain changes, rebranding, or acquisition. An entity may have multiple files (different fileId values) but always shares one entityId. Format: UUID.
entityDomain
string
REQUIRED
The primary registered domain of the entity (e.g. "example.com"). Used as a human-readable identifier and as the root for verification. Does not include protocol or path.
contentType
enum
REQUIRED
Describes what kind of data this file contains. Allows consumers to identify relevant files without parsing the full content.
fullProfile — Complete entity profile combining all available sections
identity — Basic entity identity only
services — Products and services section only
people — Leadership and personnel section only
policies — Policy declarations only
aiPolicy — AI-specific policy declarations only 
publisher
string
REQUIRED
The domain of the platform that published this file. For all files published by CrawlerFile: "crawlerfile.com"
publishedDate
date
REQUIRED
The ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) on which this version of the file was published or last updated. Consumers should use this to assess data freshness.
authorization
object
REQUIRED
An object containing all authorization and verification fields. Consolidating these fields makes the authorization chain explicit and easy for any crawler to locate. Contains the following sub-fields:
statement — Plain-language declaration of authorization, readable by humans and AI systems
authorizedBy — Legal name of the entity that authorized this profile
verificationMethod — How authorization can be verified. Enum: pageBased, metaTag, dnsTxt
entityVerificationUrl — Required when verificationMethod is pageBased or metaTag. Omit for dnsTxt. The URL where the token can be confirmed on the entity's own domain
verificationToken — A UUID that appears both in this file and at the verification location on the entity's domain. Its presence in both locations confirms authorization 

Layer 2 — Entity Identity
Core descriptive fields about the entity. These use Schema.org Organization vocabulary where applicable, extending it with additional fields where needed. All Layer 2 fields are optional — entities publish what is relevant and accurate for them.
Schema.org compatibility: CrawlerFile profiles include "@context": "https://schema.org" and "@type": "Organization" in the entity object. Fields that map directly to Schema.org properties use Schema.org field names. All field names use camelCase throughout. 
Loose schema by design: Layer 1 (the envelope) is strictly defined and must be consistent across all profiles for verification and discovery to work. Layers 2 and 3 are intentionally flexible. Entities are encouraged to publish whatever data is accurate and relevant to them, using Schema.org vocabulary where it fits and plain descriptive field names where it does not. AI consumers are well-suited to interpret varied, expressive, human-readable field names and values — rigid field constraints are not required for machine comprehension. 

Layer 3 — AI Policy
The aiPolicy object allows entities to formally declare their policies regarding the use of their data by AI systems. These declarations are timestamped and verifiable. While CrawlerFile cannot guarantee that all AI systems will honor these declarations, their publication creates a formal, machine-readable record of the entity's stated intent.
FIELD
TYPE
REQUIRED
DEFINITION
trainingDataConsent
enum
OPTIONAL
Whether the entity permits the contents of this profile to be used as training data for AI/ML models.
permitted — Unrestricted use for AI training
not_permitted — Use for AI training is not authorized
conditional — Permitted subject to conditions described in notes or at aiInquiriesContact 
retrievalConsent
enum
OPTIONAL
Whether the entity permits this profile to be used in real-time retrieval systems (e.g. RAG pipelines, search-augmented AI responses). Distinct from training consent — an entity may permit retrieval but not training.
permitted — Retrieval use is authorized
not_permitted — Retrieval use is not authorized
conditional — Permitted subject to conditions 
requiresAttribution
boolean
OPTIONAL
Whether the entity requires attribution when its data is used or cited by AI systems. If true, the preferred attribution format should be provided in attributionFormat.
attributionFormat
string
OPTIONAL
The preferred attribution string to use when citing this entity's data. Only meaningful when requiresAttribution is true. Example: "Multiplier Advisors (multiplieradvisors.com)"
dataFreshnessSLA
enum
OPTIONAL
How frequently this profile is reviewed and updated by the entity. Consumers can use this to assess whether the data is likely still current.
realtime — Continuously maintained
weekly — Reviewed weekly
monthly — Reviewed monthly
quarterly — Reviewed quarterly
annually — Reviewed annually
as_needed — Updated when significant changes occur 
expiryDate
date
OPTIONAL
ISO 8601 date after which consumers should treat this profile as potentially stale and seek a more current version. If omitted, the profile does not have a declared expiry.
aiInquiriesContact
string
OPTIONAL
An email address or URL where AI companies, researchers, or developers can direct inquiries about data use permissions for this entity.
notes
string
OPTIONAL
Free-text field for additional context about this entity's AI data use policies, particularly useful when any consent field is set to conditional.

Verification Protocol
The CrawlerFile verification protocol allows any crawler or consumer to independently confirm that the entity named in a profile has authorized its publication — without contacting CrawlerFile directly. Three verification methods are supported, declared in the authorization.verificationMethod field.
pageBased (recommended): The entity creates a page on their own domain containing the verificationToken as visible text. The entityVerificationUrl points to this page. Any crawler can fetch the page and confirm the token appears there. This is the recommended method — it requires no technical access beyond the ability to add a page, works on any website platform, and creates a human-readable public declaration of authorization. 
metaTag: The entity places the verificationToken as a meta tag in the <head> of a page on their domain. Format: <meta name="crawlerfile-verification" content="[token]">. The entityVerificationUrl points to the page containing the meta tag, typically the homepage. Requires code injection access on the entity's website platform. 
dnsTxt: The entity adds the verificationToken as a DNS TXT record on their domain. No entityVerificationUrl is needed — the crawler queries DNS for the entityDomain directly. This method is platform-independent and survives website redesigns, but requires access to DNS settings. 
STEP 01
Read the authorization object from the CrawlerFile profile. Note the verificationMethod and verificationToken.
STEP 02
For pageBased or metaTag: fetch the entityVerificationUrl. For dnsTxt: query DNS TXT records for entityDomain.
STEP 03
Confirm the verificationToken string appears in the fetched content. If it does, the entity has authorized this profile.

Versioning
CrawlerFile schema versions are identified by the schema_version field and documented at stable URLs of the form https://crawlerfile.com/schema/v{N}. This page documents v1.0.
Backwards compatibility: Minor updates to an existing version (clarifications, new optional fields) do not change the version number. Breaking changes — renamed required fields, changed enum values, structural changes — always increment the version. Existing files are never retroactively invalidated; older schema versions remain documented at their original URLs.
